	* v0.2.4 release

	* git-what-branch: Add --first-parent and --first-parent-simple options
	to allow more easy programmatic detection of failure if a commit was
	not made directly on any named branch and programmatic parse of output.

	* Exit with errors if things go wrong or at least not as the user
	probably desired (e.g. commit has not merged with a named branch, etc)

	* Bugfix: Prevent duplicate refs from being researched multiple times.
	Prevent first-parent outputs from being discussed again during
	merge-path output if --all is used.

	* Bugfix: If multiple commits are listed for research, do not have subsequent
	commits inherit bad or duplicate information from previous commits.

	* git-what-branch: Handle case when you run git-what-branch when
	you are not on a branch (no branch).
